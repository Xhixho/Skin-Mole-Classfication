A Simple Method for Classifying Moles from Other Parts of the Human Body

This method can be used not only for classification but also for data extraction, which can aid in training machine learning (ML) models to achieve better results. 
It could be particularly helpful for software that captures images of the human body for analysis.

The method is described in a Jupyter notebook file.
